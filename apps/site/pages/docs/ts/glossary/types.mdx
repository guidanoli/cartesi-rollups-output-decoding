# Types

## Address

An Ethereum account address.

Imported from [viem](https://viem.sh/docs/glossary/types#address).

## DelegateCallVoucher

A single-use permission to execute a [`DELEGATECALL`] instruction from the context of the [`Application`] contract.

### type

-   **Value:** `"delegatecallvoucher"{:ts}`

### destination

-   **Type:** [`Address`]

The Ethereum address to be called, which is typically that of a smart contract.

### payload

-   **Type**: [`Hex`]

The data to be passed along the call, which typically encodes a [Solidity function call].

## Hex

A "0x"-prefixed string.

Imported from [viem](https://viem.sh/docs/glossary/types#hex).

## Input

An input added through the [`InputBox`] contract.

### chainId

-   **Type:** `bigint`

The [EIP-155] ID of the chain to which the [`InputBox`] contract was deployed.

### appContract

-   **Type:** [`Address`]

The address of the [`Application`] contract to which the input is destined.

### msgSender

-   **Type:** [`Address`]

The address of the account that called the [`addInput`] function on the [`InputBox`] contract.
In the case of a deposit input, this should be the address of the appropriate portal contract.

### blockNumber

-   **Type:** `bigint`

The number of the block in which the input was added.

### blockTimestamp

-   **Type:** `bigint`

The timestamp of the block in which the input was added.

### prevRandao

-   **Type:** `bigint`

The latest RANDAO mix of the post beacon state of the previous block.
See [EIP-4399] for notes on how to safely use this value as a source of randomness.

### index

-   **Type:** `bigint`

The zero-based index of the input in the input box of the application.

### payload

-   **Type**: [`Hex`]

The actual data being transmitted to the application.
From the perspective of the smart contracts and the node, this is an opaque blob.
The application is free to specify any encoding for input payloads.

## Notice

A piece of verifiable information.

### type

-   **Value:** `"notice"{:ts}`

### payload

-   **Type**: [`Hex`]

The actual data being notified by the application.
From the perspective of the smart contracts and the node, this is an opaque blob.
The application is free to specify any encoding for notice payloads.

## Output

A union type of [`Notice`], [`Voucher`] and [`DelegateCallVoucher`].

You can them apart through the `type` property.

```ts twoslash
import { Output } from "@guidanoli/cmioc";

const handleOutput = (output: Output) => {
    switch (output.type) {
        case "notice": {
            const { payload } = output;
            break;
        }
        case "voucher": {
            const { destination, value, payload } = output;
            break;
        }
        case "delegatecallvoucher": {
            const { destination, payload } = output;
            break;
        }
    }
};
```

## Voucher

A single-use permission to execute a [`CALL`] instruction from the context of the [`Application`] contract.

### type

-   **Value:** `"voucher"{:ts}`

### destination

-   **Type:** [`Address`]

The Ethereum address to be called.

### value

-   **Type:** `bigint`

The amount of [Wei] to be passed along to the call.

### payload

-   **Type**: [`Hex`]

The data to be passed along the call.
If the destination address is that of a Solidity smart contract, this data generally encodes a [Solidity function call].
