# Getting Started

## Background

On [Cartesi Rollups SDK v1],
inputs and outputs had a very precise definition.
The machine could only receive inputs with EVM metadata,
and produce reports, notices, and vouchers.
Modifying this interface would certainly impact the whole stack.

In the upcoming Cartesi Rollups SDK v2 release,
we're aiming to make this interface more flexible to changes,
by encoding inputs and outputs with [Solidity Contract ABI].
On-chain, inputs will be encoded by the [`InputBox`] contract,
and outputs will be decoded by the [`Application`] contract.
Inside the machine, the [`libcmt`] tool will help decoding inputs and encoding outputs.

This change allows:

-   the [Cartesi Node] to treat inputs and outputs are opaque blobs
-   the application developer to specify new non-executable output types out-of-the-box
-   the Cartesi SDK developers to more easily add new types of executable outputs
-   the Cartesi SDK developers to more easily add new types of metadata to inputs

## Purpose

The purpose of `cmioc` is to easily encode and decode,
through a CLI tool and TypeScript library,
inputs and outputs for Cartesi Rollups SDK v2.
It is targeted to Cartesi SDK developers
and application developers in general.
