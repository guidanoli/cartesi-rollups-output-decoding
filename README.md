# Cartesi Machine Input/Output Codec

In the upcoming v2 release of the Cartesi Rollups SDK, inputs and outputs will be encoded as Solidity function calldata.
This package aims to show front-end developers how inputs and outputs can be encoded or decoded using [`viem`](https://viem.sh/) and the contract ABIs exported by [`@cartesi/rollups`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cartesi/rollups).
It also comes with a handy-dandy CLI tool.
