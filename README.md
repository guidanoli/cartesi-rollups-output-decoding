# Decoding inputs and outputs

On the upcoming Cartesi Rollups SDK v2 release, inputs and outputs will be encoded as Solidity function calldata.
The node will, through the GraphQL server, provide them in encoded form, which means someone has to decode them.

## Dependencies

- `pnpm`

## Setup

First, you'll need to install the Node dependencies.

```sh
pnpm i
```
